### Answering Prompt

**Prompt Structure:** 

This section provides our recommendation on structuring longer prompts. ?This is by no means the only way to construct effective prompts but provides a helpful framework to approach this challenge.? 

- **Introduction** – This section is used introduce the model to the purpose of the prompt, usually indicating the high-level domain of the task. It sometimes can include summary instructions about the prompt’s desired behavior. Introductions are typically short and more commonly used on longer prompts.?Intuition: The introduction “sets the mood” of the prompt. 

- **Core Instructions** – These are the instructions for the primary task that prompt should complete. They can be quite detailed and include items like output templates. Some instructions that are not specific to the task, capturing things like general behavior or user safety. They can often be shared between prompts. If you have many instructions, consider putting critical instructions towards the end. 

- **Content/Data** – This is the information is being consumed or processed by the prompt. Examples could be a document to summarized, an email to be responded to, a table to be analyzed. It could include multiple items and may be structured or unstructured. 

- **Final Instructions** – This is the final word to model before it should respond. It can act as the last summary of the task and clearly indicate the end of the prompt.? 

- **Examples** – Examples are used to demonstrate expected inputs and outputs to the model. They are typically at the end of the prompt, finishing off with a cue. 

- **Section Breaks** – These are elements that strongly delineate breaks between sections. They are used to signal to the model that the intent of the prompt content has shifted. The common most example of this is between instructions and content.? 


These are the intuitions captured in the patterns above: 

- The bulk of instructions are ordered from least to most important and appear before any content being processed, reflecting the concepts described at the technical implications section. 

- Section breaks delineate a change in the purpose of prompt text. In particular they highlight the shift between instructions, content and model response. 

- For dialogue/few-shot prompts, the transition between examples and user input should be seamless to best leverage the model’s completion behavior. 


Instructions for Instructions: Instructions play an important role in most prompts. These are some concrete tips to improve your instructions.? 

- **Create Concise Clarity** - Provide specific instructions to the model, but don't overdo it. Imagine you are giving instructions to a human. These models are trained (for the most part) on human natural language, which means that what would be clear to a human is also likely clear to the model. 

- **Use a Reference Point** - When possible, use a concept that the model will likely have encountered in its training data. For example, if you want the model to create a catchy title, ask it to write a click bait title. Ask it to write a document in the style of a newspaper journalist. If you want a short article, ask it to write a blog post. If you need a super short summary, ask for a tweet. Using these well known concepts enables you to pack lots of meaning into very few tokens.? 

- **Order Matters** - The order of your instructions can impact behavior. Later instructions are likely to be emphasized more than earlier ones. Experiment with different orders to understand the impact.? 

- **Provide Positive Instructions** – Telling the model what “to do” rather than what “not to do” is more effective. The model’s bias is to take action, so providing it a way forward is more productive. This often means using “if”, “then” instructions. For example, instead of saying something like “You must not return offensive responses” it is better to say something like “If the user requests offensive content, you should apologize and say you are unable to provide that sort of content”.? 

- **Directly Address the Model** – It has been observed that directly addressing the model with instructions of the form “You should” or “You must” result will result in better performance from the model than referring to it indirectly as “the system” or “the assistant”. 

- **Group instructions** into logical sections with an informative header.  

- **Formatting instructions** into bullet points not only helps provide clarity to the model, but also supports easy experimentation by allowing instructions to be easily added, removed, and reordered. Use MD headers to separate instructions from content. For example:

```
# Task Instructions
## You are an advanced AI writing assistant 
 
- You take in a user draft and modify it according to user instructions.  
 
- You can respond in three ways: 
 
? ? - Rewrite the draft according to user instructions. 
 
? ? - Suggest changes or give feedback on draft. 
 
? ? - You can ask follow-up questions to help improve the draft, such as "who is the intended audience?" or "what is the goal of this document?" 
 
- The user can respond with additional instructions to follow. 
 
## Your limits 
 
- If the user requests you to produce offensive content, you **must** apologetically refuse 
 
- You **must not** reproduce copyrighted material, summarizing it instead.

**Formatting:** 

We recommend the use of [Markdown (MD)](https://urlisolation.com/browser?clickId=D24F0EFF-897B-49A5-BA6E-2479331DEC7D&traceToken=1759456211%3Bbestbuy_hosted%3Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMa&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMarkdown) markup language for formatting prompts, including both instructions and content. MD not only helps the model better understand instructions and content, it can also make prompts more easily readable by humans. The models are quite good at generating MD formatted text and will quite often default to this when the input prompt uses MD. We recommend this?cheat sheet. 

**Structured & Bulk Data:** 

It is common for Microsoft LLM scenarios to involve the input and/or output of some sort of content. This section summarizes useful techniques for input and output.? 

**JSON** 

We recommend JSON for complex structured data input and easily machine readable output. 

Input?- For complex data where the model is being asked to join data and make inferences, JSON provides the best performance. JSON is easily produced and human readable. An obvious downside of JSON is that it is very costly in terms of token usage. ?Example: 
**JSON for complex structured data input:**

```

**Output?-** JSON output can be reliably produced by combining instructions with a strong cue (see the linked example). We typically use “```json” as the cue, which is the Markdown indicator for a JSON code block. That cue is so strong that will often work without JSON being otherwise mentioned at all. Example: 


Produce sample user data in JSON including FirstName, LastName, PhoneNumber and Address. 



**Markdown:** Markdown is recommended for scenarios that involve “bulk content”, that is text that involves multiple lines and paragraphs, often with several distinct instances (e.g., emails, search results) or for human readable output.?? 

- Input?- We recommend use of a Markdown horizontal rule for separating bulk content. In MD, a horizontal rule is indicated by three or more consecutive dashes, underscores or asterisks. In detail, we suggest using many dashes (up to 16 is interpreted as a single token) preceded and followed by at least three newlines. The use of dashes allows possible horizontal rules in the incoming text to be replaced by one other methods (underscores or asterisks). Multiple newlines help further distinguish between other horizontal rules that may be in the text (it is also advised to reduce the number of newlines around rules in input content). This method is recommended for its simplicity, effectiveness and conciseness. It is also recommended to use MD headers between instruction and content sections of a prompt (see the Formatting section for more).?
- Example:
```
# Instructions 
 
  
 
Summarize each of the following inputs. 
 
  
 
# Inputs 
 
  
 
  
 
---------- 
 
  
 
  
 
Article 1 
 
  
 
  
 
---------- 
 
  
 
  
 
Article 2 
 
  
 
  
 
---------- 
 
  
 
  
 
# Summaries 
```

**Markdown tables:** can be useful for situations where efficiency is important and the inferences over the structured data are less complex. MD uses significantly less tokens than JSON, however the model seems to not comprehend them quite as well as JSON.?
Example: 
```
# Books 
 
| id | title | type | author_id | editor_id | translator_id | 
 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
 
| 1 | Time to Grow Up! | original | 1 | 1 | 21 | 
 
… 
 
| 8 | My Last Book | original | 11 | 28 |  | 
 
  
 
  
 
# Authors

```

Output?- MD can be useful for producing human readable output, including tables. Instructions and a cue are helpful,?Example: 

Produce sample user data in a Markdown table including FirstName, LastName, PhoneNumber and Address. 

**XML**

XML can sometimes be an alternative to the methods described above. It is most useful when the input content has a small number of associated attributes that can be useful for the model to have awareness of. For example, if a prompt includes enterprise search results, the results can be separated by XML tags while additional information can be included as attributes within the tag (e.g., <searchResult type=”pptx” rank=”3”>).? 

 

(Almost) Always Use a Cue 

A “cue” is the last few words or characters in a prompt that acts as the prefix for the model's response. It is used to force the model output in a particular direction, more reliably producing the desired response. The cue effectively restricts the operating the space of the model. Think of the cue as “putting words into the mouth” of the model. Common applications for cues include producing a particular ouput (like JSON) or reducing hedging 

 

Examples (Are Worth 1000 Instructions) 

Including concrete examples of input/output pairs in your prompt can make a large improvement in accuracy, especially when combined with instructions. Just like human learners, working through examples can clarify many fine details that are difficult to describe indirectly. These examples can help: 

Define the expected structure for a structured output 

Demonstrate output format details 

Clarify corner cases for complex problems 

This is referred to as either few-shot or one-shot learning, depending on the number examples used. Zero-shot learning refers to prompts where no examples are used. It is important to point that the model is not truly learning in the sense that it retains any knowledge of the prompt. It only “learns” for the execution of that particular prompt. 

Recommendations: 

- Use a consistent input/output format. 

- Use both instructions and few-shot examples. 

- There's no optimal number of examples. More examples can provide clarity but use up space in your prompt. Sometimes more examples can reduce performance. You'll need to optimize for your own purposes. 

- Start with a few shots, and add examples to catch problematic cases, failed responses, etc. 

- Think carefully about which examples you provide, as they can bias the model. For instance, if you only show negative examples, then the model might be 

 
**Advanced Reasoning**

We have seen that pairing Chain-of-Thought prompting with least to most prompting is particularly effective in generalizing reasoning behaviors. These are prompting technique that can improve performance on complex tasks. 


**Chain-of-Thought** 

It has been observed that?LLMs?are able to generalize chains of thought and first order logic such that it can result in?improved gains?for many tasks such as Arithmetic, logical reasoning and other complex tasks. These LLMs can be made to learn and generalize domain specific chains-of-thought through in-context learning or, under certain circumstances, be made to produce the necessary chains of thought based on generated behaviors acquired during training (it’s “world model”) 


**Least to Most**

Another prompting approach that has demonstrate the ability to elicit reasoning with LLMs is least-to-most prompting. In this approach the prompt breaks down the tasks and then goes successively in greater depths in solving or explaining the task, breaking it down successively (potentially with the usage of chain-of-thought)?until we arrive at the answer. 


**Technical Implications for Prompt Construction** 

While for the most part we can treat the?LLM?as a black box, there is a few topics around training and architecture that can help us construct more effective prompts. 


**Completion vs Instruction Following** 

Recent GPT models are trained using two primary methods: (1) semi-supervised learning for next token prediction and (2)?RLHF?for instruction following and dialogue. A result of this is that model sometimes appears to operate in two different modes, “completion” mode and “instruction” mode which can result in significantly different behavior (to be clear: this is not designed behavior or always apparent). In completion mode, the model seems to be continuing onward with the flow of text contained in the prompt, while instruction mode generates a self-contained response which often includes a prefix such as “A possible response is” or “Possible summaries include”. It can be helpful to keep this tendency in mind when tuning your prompts. Ending your prompt with an instruction ("Summarize the article above:") typically leads to instruction mode while ending with a cue ("In summary, ") will usually lead to completion mode. 


**Left-to-Right Data Flow**

One artifact of the model architecture is that the previous tokens (words) influence the model’s interpretation of later tokens in the prompt. This means the order of elements can impact the retention, extraction and ultimately the understanding of the language in your prompt. For example, if you want the model to summarize a long text with emphasis on a particular sub-topic you should include some instruction before the text so that the model can “remember” the particularly relevant passages. ?Intuition: The model has limited attention, help the model by telling it what to look for before processing content.? 


**Recency Bias** 

Another artifact of the architecture is that that model tends to give more emphasis to the later elements of the prompt, whether they are examples or instructions. This is commonly observed with few-shot examples, where the order of the same set examples can have a significant impact on the model output.?Intuition: In general, order your prompt from least to most important, even potentially repeating key instructions.
